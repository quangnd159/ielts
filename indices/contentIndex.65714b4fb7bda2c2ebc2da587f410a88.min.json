No bulls\\*\\*t, I promise.\n\nMany of these notes will be very short, and I don't intend to write long tutorials (though there'll certainly be some). IELTS instructions are abundant on the Internet.

A wonderful moment for every parent üê•!\n\n![](images/ted-walking.gif)\n\nThe thing is, the baby doesn't think: \"If I practice hard enough, I will eventually be able to walk.\" He doesn't waste time thinking whether he should practice, what he should do, or how long it would take him to master the skill. He doesn't worry about making mistakes either. He just does his stuff, totally immersed in the process. Then, one day, just like today, bam!, he walks. Isn't it magical?\n\nAs language learners, we too must learn to trust the process. Don't feel bad if you can't speak English like your friend even though you have learned 100 new words or listened to it for several months. Trust the process. Immerse yourself in the practice.

Did you listen to English yesterday? Did you listen to English **the day before yesterday**?\n\nIf your answers were no, no, and no, good luck, it will take forever for you to get decent at the language.\n\nOf course, not all kinds of listening are equally effective, but the takeaway here is regularity, a routine, a habit.
