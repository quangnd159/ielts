Today, an increasing number of people are using the smartphone in a large part of their spare time. This essay will discuss the reasons for this development and explain why it is largely negative.\n\nThere are various reasons why many people cannot resist picking up their smartphone in their own time. For one thing, these devices provide quick and diverse entertainment, be it music, games, or all sorts of video online. Since many people are too occupied with work, they have little time left for recreation, and thus tend to see smartphones as an ideal vehicle for pleasure. Furthermore, with the advent of social media comes a new generation called \"netizens\", who spend the larger part of their day in the virtual world. Many spend every minute free of obligations on documenting their lives, interacting with friends, and exchanging gossips on social networking platforms. It is clear why people cannot help but fiddle with their phones in their free time.\n\nHowever, this modern hobby will certainly lead to many undesirable consequences. Addiction to the smartphone can adversely affect their work. When their mind becomes preoccupied with the constant activity on the net, they will find it hard to stay focused. The excessive stimulation brought by their phone will also make them intolerant to boredom, which in turn makes them easily distracted. Too much phone usage can also cause health problems, as they become unwilling to go outdoors and participate in physical activities in their free time. For many, the little free time they have before bed is also spent on the phone. This often results in sleep deprivation, which leads to a multitude of other issues, such as mood swing or eating disorder.\n\nIn conclusion, although smartphones are capable of providing their users with endless entertainment, I would argue that spending a large part of our free time on these devices will lead to long term problems, both physical and mental.\n\n(333 words)\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-09T09:56:45.331709303Z","tags":null},"/writing/marking-writing":{"title":"How your essay is read","content":"\nHere's the order in which an examiner reads and assesses your essay.\n\n- Check whether you write in paragraphs\n- Read the thesis statement\n- Read the topic sentences\n- Check the use of cohesive devices\n- Check referencing\n- Read the essay in detail\n\nThis tells you a lot about what you should show in an essay to get a good score.

The process makes use of air flows and smoke from log fire to cure[^1] meats.\n\nThe three main components of the structure are basically three holes dug in a row, connected to one another with a tunnel and a pipe. These holes are made progressively shallower to allow air to flow from one end to the other. A tall box is placed over the shallowest open hole to hang meats.\n\nThe way the smokery works is simple. First, the lid on the deepest pit is raised to let air in. This air then blows into a tunnel that connects with the fire pit, which is sealed with a tight-fitting lid. As a result, the smoke from the burning logs is carried by the air current through the pipe on the other side into the last hole. Here, the smoke, along with the heat, goes through about two layers of bricks to be evenly dispersed inside the box, smoking the fish or chicken meat that is hung on its ceiling.\n\n(206 words)\n\n[^1]: cure: to treat food¬†with smoke, salt or heat, etc. in order to preserve it\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-09T09:56:45.331709303Z","tags":null},"/writing/simple":{"title":"Simple but correct","content":"\n\n\u003e [!success] Did you know...\n\u003e \n\u003e Simpler but correct language will earn you a better score for vocabulary than inaccurate usage of \"advanced\" words and phrases.\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è When you use big words incorrectly, you risk reducing communication and thus capping your vocabulary score at 5.","lastmodified":"2022-10-09T09:56:45.331709303Z","tags":null}}
