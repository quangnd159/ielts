He doesn't worry about making mistakes either. He just does his stuff, totally immersed in the process. Then, one day, just like today, bam!, he walks. Isn't it magical?\n\nAs language learners, we too must learn to trust the process.

Later, when you learn another foreign language, you'll find it easier to learn its pronunciation because you can make sound comparisons.
