Here's the order in which an examiner reads and assesses your essay.

- Check whether you write in paragraphs
- Read the thesis statement
- Read the topic sentences
- Check the use of cohesive devices
- Check referencing
- Read the essay in detail

This tells you a lot about what you should show in an essay to get a good score. One **takeaway** is that we must achieve overall coherence, because the examiner will check it first.
