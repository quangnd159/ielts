I'm well aware that it has been 10 years since I graduated from university, but sometimes the thought comes to mind and I respond, quite audibly, "Oh f**k!". 10 years. In an ideal world, this is when old classmates would text each other, asking about a reunion. But I think my class's reunion won't happen in this lifetime.

But then again, perhaps I don't deserve a class reunion. I was a pain in the arse to many of my friends back in the day. Though I wasn't an unbearable person, I certainly was a self-centered, sentimental prick, now that I think about it. I was the fun ruiner, that one guy thought the world must revolve around him. On many occasions, I cried in front of my friends, like a bitch.  Growing up watching a ton of melodramatic Korean shows surely didn't help.
