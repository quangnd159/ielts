## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is where I share my notes on IELTS when I have some time to spare. No bulls\*\*t, I promise.

Many of these notes will be very short, and I don't intend to write long tutorials (though there'll certainly be some). IELTS instructions are abundant on the Internet. In this notebook I focus on the little details you might have missed or aren't told.

I used to write some Vietnamese content on ai-eo.com, but I can no longer maintain it. Everything will be moved over here eventually.
