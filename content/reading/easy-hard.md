I got 9 for [reading](https://dangquang.xyz/m/ielts/).

Getting a 9 for reading can be hard for many candidates, but to me (at least in the last exam) it's easy. It's easy when I can understand everything in the text.

Taking the test isn't hard. The hard part is practice. The hard part is building the [reading habit](https://dangquang.xyz/t/kindle/). The hard part is having the discipline necessary to immerse yourself in the language every day.

If you're still looking for "the secret", the truth is that you're only trying to delay the work.
