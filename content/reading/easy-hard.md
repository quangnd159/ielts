[Getting a 9 for reading](https://dangquang.xyz/m/ielts/) can be hard for many candidates, but to me (at least in the last exam) it's not too big of a challenge. It's easy when I can understand everything in the text.

Taking the test isn't hard. The hard part is [[general/process|practice]]. The hard part is building the [reading habit](https://dangquang.xyz/t/kindle/). The hard part is having the discipline necessary to **immerse** yourself in the language every day.

If you're still looking for "the secret", the truth is that you're only trying to delay the work.
