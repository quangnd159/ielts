I'm going to tell you one secret to native-like English speaking ability. Shh... don't tell anyone.

Just kidding. Everyone knows. The secret is "shadowing": (1) find a speaker whose voice you like, (2) pick a video by that person, and (3) try to copy their speech perfectly (which takes a tremendous amount of time, but is totally doable)

[Here's a video of me practicing with the technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrL4JJXL2OQ) (8 years ago!) I didn't even know it was called "shadow technique". I was copying John Green.
