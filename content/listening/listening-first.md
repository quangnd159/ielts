Just like [[reading/easy-hard|reading]], getting 9 for listening isn't hard. Well, I admit that it is a bit harder since you'll have to give 100% focus. But the point is, unlike writing where you have to learn different techniques and skills, practicing listening is simple: just listen regularly.

Here's a little test for you: Did you listen to English today? Did you listen to English yesterday? Did you listen to English **the day before yesterday**?

If your answers were no, no, and no, good luck, it will take forever for you to get decent at the language.

Of course, not all kinds of listening are equally effective, but the takeaway here is regularity, a routine, a habit. Build it, and the rest will fall into place.
