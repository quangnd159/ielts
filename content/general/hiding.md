You don't need talent to learn a language. Everyone is born with the capacity. There's no secret to mastering one either. With a quick Google search, you'll see a great number of people already spilling the beans all over the internet.

So everytime we complain that we don't know what to do, or that we don't have the rigth resources (bruh! did you hear about this thing called "internet"?), you're finding a reason to hide, to delay the work.

Trust the [[process]]. Just do.
